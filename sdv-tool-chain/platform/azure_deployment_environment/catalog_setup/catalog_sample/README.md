# SDV Toolchain ADE Catalog Sample

This directory provides a sample catalog for an Azure dev center.

This catalog contains:
* `env.ARM.template.json`: A parameterized ARM template for deploying an Azure virtual machine based on an image from an Azure compute gallery (and all necessary networking resources).
  * The parameter definitions in this file contain metadata explaining what they are used for.
* `environment.yaml`: A yaml file that provides metadata about the environment definition.
